## Project: The 15-Minute City Accessibility Map For Riverbank, CA

### Overview
This project analyzes accessibility in Riverbank, California, to determine which neighborhoods can reach essential services such as schools, parks, grocery stores, and healthcare within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. It identifies underserved areas and provides recommendations for improving mobility and equity in Riverbank, CA.

### Objectives
- Map walkable and bikeable access to key amenities  
- Perform service area and network analysis  
- Identify gaps in accessibility  
- Suggest infrastructure improvements  

### Data Sources
- **OpenStreetMap** — Street network (roads) and amenities  
- **Overpass Turbo** — Amenities GeoJSON extraction  
- **US Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles** — Census boundaries  
- **StanRTA GTFS Data** — Transit stops (GTFS ZIP file)  

### Tools Used
- QGIS 3.44.1  
- QNEAT3 Plugin  
- QuickOSM Plugin  

### Key Findings
- Most central neighborhoods in Riverbank have good walking access to schools and groceries.  
- Parks are limited, leaving some neighborhoods underserved.  
- Healthcare facilities are accessible mainly by bike, not within 15 minutes walking distance.  
- Equity gaps exist on the outer edges of the city.  

### Deliverables
- Static maps (PDF)  
- Processed geospatial data (GeoPackage, shapefiles)  
- Documentation (this README)  

### Recommendations for Underserved Areas
Based on the accessibility analysis, several neighborhoods in Riverbank fall outside the 15-minute walk or bike catchment for key amenities. To address these gaps, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. **Grocery Stores & Healthy Food Access**  
   - Support the establishment of small-format grocery stores, farmers markets, or community food hubs in underserved neighborhoods.  
   - Explore partnerships with mobile vendors to reduce “food desert” conditions.  

2. **Schools & Educational Facilities**  
   - Expand safe walking and biking routes to schools through improved crosswalks, sidewalks, and bike lanes.  
   - Consider siting future school facilities in neighborhoods with limited access to existing campuses.  

3. **Healthcare Services**  
   - Introduce neighborhood health clinics or urgent care centers in areas outside the 15-minute reach of existing facilities.  
   - Explore mobile health units as a short-term solution for residents without access to transit.  

4. **Parks & Open Spaces**  
   - Prioritize creation of pocket parks or green spaces in neighborhoods without walkable access to recreation.  
   - Use vacant or underutilized parcels as opportunities for small community parks.  

5. **Transportation & Connectivity**  
   - Extend bus or shuttle routes to link underserved neighborhoods with essential services.  
   - Add protected bike lanes and continuous sidewalks to reduce travel time by active modes.  

6. **Urban Planning & Policy**  
   - Adopt zoning incentives for **mixed-use development** that brings groceries, clinics, and other amenities closer to housing.  
   - Integrate “15-minute city” principles into long-term city planning to ensure equitable accessibility.
